# **PIC Programming Tutorial #18 - Comparator & Interrupt Base Program**

This demonstrates how to setup the comparator and using the internal voltage reference to trigger a LED output based on an external voltage input. Along with the comparator the video show how to program the PIC with interrupts to enter sleep state and wake when there is a state change on the inputs or an internal interrupt trigger from the timers or analog to digital converter. Using the XC8 compiler with MPLAB X and a PIC18F4520.
